# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
Mostly review just slightly different from JavaScript
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods allow you to efficiently code not needing to write over complicated functions to achieve a certain result. can be useful incases where you dont want a search bar for example to be case sensitive so you downcase the input and have it search through results that are only visibly downcased for the code. you retain a an image for the user that appears grammatically correct while keeping things easy to use while in the background you have simplified code.
